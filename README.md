Modifying programs to light up raspberry pi with hangman game

The end goal is to have a hangman program that lights up an 8x8 matrix on a raspberry pi
The pi should light up with letters to select and a second pi matrix should show the man to be hanged.
Currently the pi should light up to display the hanged man as the game progresses but it
seems that the functionality isn't quite fully recognized.

The peppe file has been modified to work with the main hangman program but the functionality leaves
much to be desired.
